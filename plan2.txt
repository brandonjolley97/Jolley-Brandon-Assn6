Requirement Specifications:
    -This program must accept user input for the employee's name, the number of hours worked in a week, the hourly pay rate, the federal tax withholding rate, and the state withholding rate.
    -It then must calculate deductions due to federal and stated taxes.
    -Finally, it should display the pay and deductions in a format following the given example and tell the user their net pay.
System Analysis:
    -The desired output will be the pay and deduction information based on user input.  The gross and net pay and deductions will be calculated following the formulas below.
        > grossPay = hoursWorked * payRate
        > netPay = grossPay - totalDeductions
        > federalDeductions = federalTax * grossPay
        > stateDeductions = stateTax * grossPay
        > totalDeductions = federalDeductions + stateDeductions
