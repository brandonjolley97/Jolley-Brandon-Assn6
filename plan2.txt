Requirement Specifications:
    -This program must accept user input for the employee's name, the number of hours worked in a week, the hourly pay rate, 
    -It then must calculate the area of the polygon.
    -
System Analysis:
    -The desired output will be the area of the n-sided polygon, which is calculated by this formula.
    - area = (n * (s ** 2)) / (4 * math.tan(math.pi / n)) where n is the number of sides and s is the side length.
System Design:
    -Prompt the user to input the number of sides and the length of the sides of the polygon.
    -Compute the area using the formula given in the 3.5 exercise instructions.
    -Display the area.
Implementation:
    -See task1.py file for code
